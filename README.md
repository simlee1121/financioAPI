The project and database name are both called FinancioAPI.

I have created a table called interview_applicants.

The files I have written are api.php and InterviewApplicantsController.php.

Mysql file = financioapi.sql

Here is the video link for testing the API https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXjEgzA2a38
